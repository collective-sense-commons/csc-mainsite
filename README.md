## Why Join With Collective Sense Commons?

The CSC services allow organizations to coordinate, communicate, and collaborate with others to create a shared information commons.

Services provided by CSC do not require payment, which allows individuals and ad hoc organizations to get going right away, even if they do not have a formal accounts payable infrastructure yet.

To support itself and its members, CSC encourages alternative exchanges of value.
