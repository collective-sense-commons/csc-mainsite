## Welcome to Collective Sense Commons

Collective Sense Commons was a five-year public benefit project organized and supported by Peter Kaminski and others to provide coordination, communication, and sensemaking tools to individuals and organizations involved with collective sensemaking. It operated from October 2020 to October 2025. Organizations and individuals were encouraged to use and protect the services as a community commons.
